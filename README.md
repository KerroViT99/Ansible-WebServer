Playbook for fully automated deployment of one or more web servers (Nginx + Apache)

## Usage

1) Install Ansible:

   Debian:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install ansible
   ```

2) Run init.sh and follow the instructions:

   ```bash
   ./init.sh
   ```

WARNING: Do not run the playbook directly from the server on which you plan to deploy!

NOTE: In case of deploying a web server with HTTPS (option 1), the certificate
and key files must be on the server at the time of deployment!

## Deployment options

- HTTP
- HTTPS
  - With a pre-prepared certificate (option 1)
  - With a certificate obtained from Let's Encrypt (option 2)
  - With a self-signed certificate (option 3)

## What will be installed and configured?

- Nginx (Frontend)
- Apache (Backend)
- Apache Modules
  - mod_fastcgi
  - mod_remoteip
- PHP-FPM
- DBMS (optional)

- phpMyAdmin (optional)
- Knockd (optional)
- SFTP Server (optional)
- Fail2ban (optional) (in development)
- Firewall (optional)

## What will be done to improve security?

- Hiding Nginx and Apache versions
- Blocking access to the Apache port

- Protecting Nginx from slow requests
- SSH protection with Port-Knocking (optional)
- Blocking access to phpMyAdmin via .htpasswd and .htaccess (optional)
